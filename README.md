## Requirements

- Node.js v6.9+
- Yarn or npm client
- Neutrino v5

## Installation

`neutrino-preset-react` can be installed via the Yarn or npm clients. Inside your project, make sure
`neutrino` and `neutrino-preset-react` are development dependencies. You will also need React and React DOM for actual
React development.

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn add --dev neutrino neutrino-preset-react
❯ yarn add react react-dom
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm install --save-dev neutrino neutrino-preset-react
❯ npm install --save react react-dom
```

## Project Layout

`neutrino-preset-react` follows the standard [project layout](https://neutrino.js.org/project-layout) specified by Neutrino. This
means that by default all project source code should live in a directory named `src` in the root of the
project. This includes JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and any other assets that would be available
to your compiled project.

## Quickstart

After installing Neutrino and the React preset, add a new directory named `src` in the root of the project, with
a single JS file named `index.js` in it.

```bash
❯ mkdir src && touch src/index.js
```

This React preset exposes an element in the page with an ID of `root` to which you can mount your application. Edit
your `src/index.js` file with the following:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

render(<h1>Hello world!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Now edit your project's package.json to add commands for starting and building the application:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "neutrino start --presets neutrino-preset-react",
    "build": "neutrino build --presets neutrino-preset-react"
  }
}
```

Start the app, then open a browser to the address in the console:

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn start
✔ Development server running on: http://localhost:5000
✔ Build completed
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm start
✔ Development server running on: http://localhost:5000
✔ Build completed
```

## Building

`neutrino-preset-react` builds static assets to the `build` directory by default when running `neutrino build`. Using
the quick start example above as a reference:

```bash
❯ yarn build
clean-webpack-plugin: /react/build has been removed.
Build completed in 6.692s

Hash: 7a83f769b15f88b80727
Version: webpack 2.2.1
Time: 6695ms
                                  Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
   index.b615ea9e95317f530317.bundle.js     143 kB    0, 1  [emitted]  index
manifest.2211d9c1970bbd3c952b.bundle.js    1.41 kB       1  [emitted]  manifest
                             index.html  779 bytes          [emitted]
✨  Done in 8.32s.
```

You can either serve or deploy the contents of this `build` directory as a static site.

## Customizing

To override the build configuration, start with the documentation on [customization](https://neutrino.js.org/customization).
`neutrino-preset-react` does not use any additional named rules, loaders, or plugins that aren't already in use by the
Web preset. See the [Web documentation customization](../neutrino-preset-web#customizing)
for preset-specific configuration to override.

### Simple customization

By following the [customization guide](https://neutrino.js.org/customization/simple) and knowing the rule, loader, and plugin IDs above,
you can override and augment the build directly from package.json.

#### Vendoring

By defining an entry point in package.json named `vendor` you can split out external dependencies into a chunk separate
from your application code. When working with a React application, it is recommended to start out by splitting off
React and React DOM into the `vendor` chunk.

_Example: Put React and React DOM into a separate "vendor" chunk:_

```json
{
  "neutrino": {
    "config": {
      "entry": {
        "vendor": [
          "react",
          "react-dom"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^15.4.2",
    "react-dom": "^15.4.2"
  }
}
```

Running the build again, you can contrast the bundles generated here with the one generated in the quick start:

```bash
❯ yarn build
clean-webpack-plugin: /react/build has been removed.
Build completed in 6.726s

Hash: 0468e662989da55bdc5e
Version: webpack 2.2.1
Time: 6730ms
                                  Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
  vendor.0b3c06ba6b2494d683ee.bundle.js     142 kB    0, 2  [emitted]  vendor
   index.d264625fd405d81cb995.bundle.js  276 bytes    1, 2  [emitted]  index
manifest.29ee4d0db8f2534cc643.bundle.js    1.44 kB       2  [emitted]  manifest
                             index.html  866 bytes          [emitted]
✨  Done in 8.21s.
```

#### HTML files

If you wish to override how HTML files are created for your React app, refer to the [relevant section on
neutrino-preset-web](https://neutrino.js.org/neutrino-preset-web#html-files).

_Example: Change the application mount ID from "root" to "app":_

```json
{
  "neutrino": {
    "options": {
      "html": {
        "appMountId": "app"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced configuration

By following the [customization guide](https://neutrino.js.org/customization/advanced) and knowing the rule, loader, and plugin IDs from
neutrino-preset-web, you can override and augment the build by creating a JS module which overrides the config.

#### Vendoring

By defining an entry point named `vendor` you can split out external dependencies into a chunk separate
from your application code.

_Example: Put React and React DOM into a separate "vendor" chunk:_

```js
module.exports = neutrino => {
  neutrino.config
    .entry('vendor')
      .add('react')
      .add('react-dom');
};
```

## Hot Module Replacement

While `neutrino-preset-react` supports Hot Module Replacement your app using React Hot Loader, it does require some
application-specific changes in order to operate.

First, install `react-hot-loader` as a dependency, this **must** be React Hot Loader v3+ (currently in beta):

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn add react-hot-loader@next
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm install --save react-hot-loader@next
```

---

- From your `index` entry point (defaults to `src/index.js` from `neutrino.options.entry`), import an `AppContainer`
from `react-hot-loader`.
- Wrap your top-level React component in the `AppContainer`.
- Perform the application render in a reusable function for initial load and subsequent reloads.
- Add the `hot` acceptance to call this function.

For example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader';
import MyApp from './MyApp';

const load = () => render((
  <AppContainer>
    <MyApp />
  </AppContainer>
), document.getElementById('root'));

if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./MyApp', load);
}

load();
```
